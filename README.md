Russel's ReactJS Test Repo

if you're reading this, i did not succeed at all with this test. i tried doing it from scratch and failed miserably. this is also my first ever time trying to learn to use both reactjs and visual studio code, and so far i do not like both of these. i already have my brain full of learning flutter and swift, i can and will not overload it with react. i will accept any consequence since i dont have a choice anyway, if you wanted to receive a better result, please look for a dedicated react developer or a full-stack, unfortunately i am not either of those.
